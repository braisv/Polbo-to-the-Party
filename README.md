# INTRODUCTION
First project working with JS and Canvas. There's lack of octopus in our restaurants so we need to refill our kitchens with the best creature of the seven seas. Be careful with the watersnakes and don't fall off the boat.

# INSTRUCTIONS
Move the boat with your arrow keys and if you need a break, you can pause the game with space key.

# GOALS & IMPROVEMENTS
The movement of the boat should be as realistic as possible. This is something I'm still working on. In spite of being proud of how it looks nowaday, I will upload the movement method when it's finished.
